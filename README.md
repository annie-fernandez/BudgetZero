# Budget-Zero

Budget-Zero is a finances and budget manager. Built with ReactJS on the frontend and Supabase as a backend.

## Inspiration

Navigating our finances has often been a daunting task, and lacking a clear visual of what we were expending held us back from fulfilling financial objectives. Recognizing this common struggle, we embarked on a journey to create an intuitive budget application. Aiming to make budgeting effortlessly efficient, and helping people accomplish financial dreams.

## What it does

BudgetZero simplifies expense tracking, offering valuable insights into your spending habits. It also provides clarity on your annual gross income and tax percentage, giving you a comprehensive view of your financial landscape. With our powerful search functionality, you can quickly create and locate transactions by name and amount, making financial management a breeze. Additionally, we enhance your financial organization by categorizing expenses, providing an intuitive visual representation of your financial journey.

## How we built it

Our team developed a front-end application with a focus on delivering a sophisticated user interface and an uninterrupted, accessible experience. For this purpose, we chose ReactJS integrated with TypeScript, while utilizing Mantine as our primary component library.

On the back-end, we employed Supabase in conjunction with a PostgreSQL database. We also incorporated an AWS S3 API to handle user profile images. To ensure secure user access, we implemented row-level security policies. Furthermore, we streamlined the management of REST functionality through the Supabase front-end library.

Our authentication mechanisms encompass traditional email and password authentication, complemented by external single sign-on providers such as Discord and GitHub.

Lastly, to ensure efficient and up-to-date delivery, we established a continuous deployment workflow. This automates the deployment of our main branch to production with every push.

## Challenges we ran into

Our first challenge was gathering the requirements needed to build our idea, as well as the technologies that could best fit our needs. After this, we struggled with authentication and user management, which held us back for a while, but evolved into one of our standout features.
Accomplishments that we're proud of

One of our most notable achievements was implementing safe user authentication within our application, as well as establishing row-level security within our database to grant specific permissions.

Another significant accomplishment was our effective teamwork. Given the multitude of ideas and suggestions from our team members, we had to meticulously navigate through various concepts to ensure they could all be incorporated within our project's timeline. This collaborative effort enabled us to harness the collective input of our team, resulting in a well-rounded and successful application.

## What we learned

We learned how to work effectively as a team, with team members taking on different roles, including designers, front-end and back-end engineers, and product managers. This collaboration allowed us to build an impressive product, and gain invaluable experience in problem-solving.

## What's next for Budget-Zero

We have ambitious plans for BudgetZero. Given its potential usefulness for individuals who, like us, face challenges in managing their finances, we are eager to expand its feature set. Beyond the hackathon, we are committed to further developing this application, especially its transformation into a mobile app accessible on both iOS and Android platforms, allowing us to reach and assist an even wider audience.
